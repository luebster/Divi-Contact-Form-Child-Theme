This is a Divi Child theme that adds a From email address to the Contact Form configuration settings. When the contact form is submitted, the email will use the value in the From field as the From header in the email itself. If there is no value set, the From address will default to norply@[hostname], i.e. noreply@example.com.

1. Install and active the child theme.
